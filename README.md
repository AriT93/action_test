# action_test
testing github actions

This is me testing actions and seeing if I can generate attestations.
I was able to use the `slsa-github-generator` and will alslo try the
`attest-build-provenance` action as well to see how that works. 

I don't think these will be available on the on-prem github enterprise
but [this option is maybe a
thing](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.14/admin/managing-github-actions-for-your-enterprise/managing-access-to-actions-from-githubcom/manually-syncing-actions-from-githubcom)  

This is in no way a note to myself tomorrow


Also, too,
[witness-run](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/witness-run)

and while were at it [attest-build-provenance](https://github.com/actions/attest-build-provenance)
